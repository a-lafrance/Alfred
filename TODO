each command has a grammar

All possible input sentences (currently):

"[Verb] `<command>`" where Verb is one of several pre-defined options, such as "Run", "Execute", "Do", etc
"[VP] what's in <dir>" where VP is "Show me", "List", "Tell me", etc
"[VP] the contents of <dir>" where VP is "Show me", "List", "Tell me", etc
"What's inside <dir>?"
"[Verb] <path> to <new path>" where Verb is "Move" or "Rename"
"Place <path> in <dir>"
"Move everything in <dir> to <new dir>" for glob moves
"[Verb] <path> to <new path>" where Verb is "Copy" or "Duplicate"
"[Verb] everything in <dir> to <new dir>" for glob copies, where Verb is "Copy" or "Duplicate"
"[Verb] [everything in <dir> | <path>] [recursively?]" where Verb is "Delete", "Remove", "Get rid of", etc;
  adding "recursively" at the beginning or end only works for directories, and produces an error otherwise;
  "everything in <dir>" works for glob removals

Will need some kind of "catchall" thing using backticks
