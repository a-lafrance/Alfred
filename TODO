Input:
- one main grammar for the whole chatbot
- each command contributes to that grammar's syntax and lexicon however it needs to
- use cyk parse to parse input into parse tree
  - if parse fails, return error

Semantics:
- each command is given a chance to interpret the parse tree
  - if successful, that command is executed
  - if all commands fail, return error
- each command has some parameters that it has to fulfill -- extract them from parse tree and exec the command
  - need to find a way to parse non-alphabetical grammar stuff, like commas (for conjunction) and regex (for paths/directories)
- python probably has some way to execute system commands but i forget what it is

Output:
- each command has its own output grammar (distinct from input grammar)
- for error output, just return a generic error message (sample from common error output grammar)
- for command output, sample from that command's output grammar

step 1: fix cyk parse
- literally make the grammar functional and the cyk parse implementation foolproof

step 2: impl command input
- make command classes and make them able to interpret a parse tree

step 3: semantics
- implement command execution

step 4: output
- figure out how to sample from a grammar (or just hard code stuff idk)
- print to user

step 5: refine
- add extras
- tighten up the interface
- etc
